<h1>Hi, I'm Juned, A Cyber-Awareness Advocate<br/></h1>


<br/>
<h2>🧐 A bit About Me</h2>
I do my part in spreading awareness for online security by posting <b>(feel free to check out the Linkedin below)</b><br/>
and enganging with cyber-experts (and non-cyber experts) by attending industry events.<br/><br/>

Recently got into OSINT 🕵️, so currently in that phase where I look forward to doing a challange every day after work.<br/><br/>

I spend my free time trying out different tools & learning about technologies <b>(have a look below 👇).<br/>
